In script 1.11, we loaded, demultimplexed HTOs, filtered for QC, ran PCA, clustering and UMAP.
The seurat object was then saved so it can be read in here without repeating any of the above steps.
We also ran find cluster biomarkers which was saved to a csv file that can now be read in

```{r}
scCHANTS_pbmc <- readRDS("/cephfs/volumes/hpc_data_prj/id_hill_sims_wellcda/c1947608-5b3a-4d60-8179-b8e0779d7319/scratch_tmp/scCHANTS/20250616_benchmark/20250616_scCHANTS_pbmc_processed.Rds")
```
